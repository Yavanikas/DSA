Problem:
Find first and last position of a target in a sorted array.

Idea:
Use binary search twice.
Once biased to the left to find first occurrence.
Once biased to the right to find last occurrence.

Why binary search works:
Array is sorted, so half can be discarded each time.

Time Complexity:
- O(log n) for each search.
- Total O(log n).

2) Rotated Sorted Array – Number of Rotations

Problem:
Given a sorted array that has been rotated some number of times,
find the number of rotations.

Key Observation:
- The number of rotations is equal to the index of the minimum element.
- The minimum element is the only place where the sorted order breaks.

Linear Approach:
- Scan the array from left to right.
- Find the first index where arr[i] < arr[i-1].
- That index is the number of rotations.
- If no such index exists, the array is not rotated.

Time Complexity:
- O(n)

Binary Search Approach:
- In a rotated sorted array, at least one half is always sorted.
- If the array between beg and end is already sorted, beg is the answer.
- Otherwise, find mid and check if it is smaller than its neighbors.
- If mid is the minimum element, its index is the number of rotations.
- Discard the sorted half and continue searching.

Time Complexity:
- O(log n)
