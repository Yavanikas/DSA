DAY 1 – SEARCHING & BIG O

n = size of input (array length)

Linear Search:
- Check elements one by one
- Worst case checks all elements
- Time Complexity: O(n)

Binary Search:
- Works only on sorted array
- Cuts search space in half each step
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

Big O talks about worst-case growth, not exact time.
